SEAP Code for the Roomba iRobot

Extract this into your Tomcat webapps directory. The command follows the form unzip <file> -d <destination> which will be something like unzip /home/jars/Desktop/roomba.zip -d /home/jars/tomcat5.5/webapps/

I left the php files, but you'll use roomba.jsp. Let me know if you run into any problems.
